## Coding Standards
When working with Laravel/PHP projects, first read the coding guidelines at @~/.claude/laravel-php-guidelines.md
Include, also, guidelines from @./.github/copilot-instructions.md

Do not add obvious comments to the code.
Use user slug for URLs and public views.
Do not create unnecessary functions or methods that might be used in the future.

The first input of a form should be autofocused (ignore if the first is photo or file upload).
Use Preline UI for UI components.
All buttons and links should have a cursor pointer.
