## Coding Standards
When working with Laravel/PHP projects, first read the coding guidelines at @~/.claude/laravel-php-guidelines.md
Include, also, guidelines from @./.github/copilot-instructions.md

Do not add obvious comments to the code.

The first input of a form should be autofocused.
Use Preline UI for UI components.
All buttons and links should have a cursor pointer.
